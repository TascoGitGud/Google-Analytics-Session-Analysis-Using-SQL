## 📂 Dataset

The analysis is based on the **AdventureWorks database**, which represents a large bicycle manufacturing and sales company operating internationally. It contains data on products, customers, sales orders, purchasing, and inventory across many regions.

### Data Dictionary

To answer the 8 business questions in this project, **8 tables** from the `Sales`, `Production`, and `Purchasing` schemas were used. The table below lists only the columns that were actually used.

| Schema | Table Name | Columns Used | Used In | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sales** | `SalesOrderHeader` | `SalesOrderID`, `OrderDate`, `CustomerID`, `TerritoryID`, `Status`, `ModifiedDate` | Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5 | Provides order dates, territory IDs, customer IDs, and order status for sales-side queries. |
| **Sales** | `SalesOrderDetail` | `SalesOrderID`, `ProductID`, `OrderQty`, `LineTotal`, `UnitPrice`, `SpecialOfferID` | Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q7 | Line-item table holding order quantities, revenue, and prices used to calculate sales volume and totals. |
| **Sales** | `SpecialOffer` | `SpecialOfferID`, `DiscountPct`, `Type` | Q4 | Identifies "Seasonal Discount" offers and their discount percentages to calculate discount cost. |
| **Production** | `Product` | `ProductID`, `Name`, `ProductSubcategoryID` | Q1, Q2, Q4, Q6, Q7 | Maps product IDs to product names and subcategory IDs. |
| **Production** | `ProductSubcategory` | `ProductSubcategoryID`, `Name` | Q1, Q2, Q4 | Groups products into subcategories for sales volume and YoY growth comparisons. |
| **Production** | `WorkOrder` | `ProductID`, `StockedQty`, `ModifiedDate` | Q6, Q7 | Supplies stocked quantities by month, used for stock trend and stock-to-sales ratio. |
| **Purchasing** | `PurchaseOrderHeader` | `PurchaseOrderID`, `Status`, `TotalDue`, `ModifiedDate` | Q8 | Provides purchase order status and total value to find Pending (`Status = 1`) orders in 2014. |
| **Purchasing** | `PurchaseOrderDetail` | `PurchaseOrderID` | Q8 | Joined to the purchase order header to count distinct pending purchase orders. |

## 🔎 Query Repository

### Query 1: Sales Volume L12M

*Question: Calc Quantity of items, Sales value & Order quantity by each Subcategory in L12M.*

> _Tracking the last 12 months of sales by subcategory helps the business spot which product lines are growing or declining in real time - so inventory and marketing budgets can be adjusted before it's too late._

```sql
WITH
  sales_order_with_date AS(
    SELECT
      sales_detail.SalesOrderID,
      sales_detail.ProductID,
      sales_detail.OrderQty,
      sales_detail.LineTotal,
      DATE(sales_header.OrderDate) as order_date,
      MAX(DATE(sales_header.OrderDate)) OVER() AS last_order_date,
      DATE_SUB(MAX(DATE(sales_header.OrderDate)) OVER(), INTERVAL 12 MONTH) L12M
    FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` sales_detail
    INNER JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderHeader` sales_header
    ON sales_detail.SalesOrderID = sales_header.SalesOrderID
  ),
  sales_in_L12M AS(
    SELECT
      s.SalesOrderID, s.OrderQty, s.LineTotal,	
      FORMAT_DATE('%b %Y', s.order_date) period,
      p.ProductSubcategoryID,
      sub.name AS product_subcategory
    FROM sales_order_with_date s
    LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` p ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID
    LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` sub ON CAST(p.ProductSubcategoryID AS INT64) = sub.ProductSubcategoryID
    WHERE order_date >= L12M
  )
SELECT
  period,
  product_subcategory, 
  SUM(OrderQty) AS qty_item,
  ROUND(SUM(LineTotal), 4) as total_sales,
  COUNT(SalesOrderID) AS oder_cnt
FROM sales_in_L12M
GROUP BY period, product_subcategory
ORDER BY total_sales DESC, product_subcategory;
```

**📊 Actual Output:**
![Query 1 Output](Images/Query_01_Output.png)

**💡 Observations:**

Road Bikes is the best seller with $2.1M in March 2014 and 2,371 units sold. Touring Bikes and Mountain Bikes also perform well across all months.

Road Bikes makes the most money, so the store should focus on keeping this category strong with good inventory and marketing.

---

### Query 2: YoY Growth Rate by Category

*Question: Calc % YoY growth rate by SubCategory & release top 3 cat with highest grow rate. Can use metric: quantity_item. Round results to 2 decimal.*

> _Identifying the top 3 fastest-growing subcategories gives leadership a clear signal of where demand is heading - useful for production planning and deciding where to invest next._

```sql
WITH
  sales_with_date AS (
    SELECT
      sales_detail.SalesOrderID order_id,
      sales_detail.ProductID product_id,
      sales_detail.OrderQty order_qty,
      DATE(sales_header.OrderDate) as order_date,
    FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` sales_detail
    INNER JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderHeader` sales_header
      ON sales_detail.SalesOrderID = sales_header.SalesOrderID
  ),
  sales_with_date_subcate_name AS (
    SELECT
      order_id, product_id, order_qty,
      EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) order_year,
      p.ProductSubcategoryID product_subcate_id,
      sub.Name subcate_name
    FROM sales_with_date s
    LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` p ON s.product_id = p.ProductID
    LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` sub ON CAST(p.ProductSubcategoryID AS INT64) = sub.ProductSubcategoryID
  ),
  qty_sum_by_subcate AS(
    SELECT order_year, subcate_name, SUM(order_qty) qty_item
    FROM sales_with_date_subcate_name
    GROUP BY subcate_name, order_year
  ),
qty_growth AS(
  SELECT
    a.order_year, a.subcate_name, a.qty_item,
    b.order_year prev_year, b.qty_item prev_qty_item,
    ROUND((a.qty_item/b.qty_item - 1), 2) qty_diff,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY ROUND((a.qty_item/b.qty_item - 1), 2) DESC) as growth_rank
  FROM qty_sum_by_subcate a
  LEFT JOIN qty_sum_by_subcate b ON a.subcate_name = b.subcate_name AND a.order_year = b.order_year + 1
 )
SELECT subcate_name Name, qty_item, prev_qty_item prv_qty, qty_diff
FROM qty_growth WHERE growth_rank <= 3 ORDER BY qty_diff DESC;
```

**📊 Actual Output:**
![Query 2 Output](Images/Query_2_Output.png)

**💡 Observations:**

Mountain Frames grew the most with 510% more sales. Socks also grew a lot at 421%, and Road Frames at 389%.

These three products are selling much better than before, so the store should stock more of them and focus on marketing these fast-growing items.

---

### Query 3: Top Territories by Year

*Question: Ranking Top 3 TeritoryID with biggest Order quantity of every year. If there's TerritoryID with same quantity in a year, do not skip the rank number.*

> _Knowing which territories consistently drive the most orders helps the sales team prioritize regional resources and flag underperforming areas that may need support._

```sql
WITH 
  territory_vs_order_count AS (
    SELECT 
      EXTRACT(YEAR FROM OrderDate) yr,
      TerritoryID,
      SUM(OrderQty) order_cnt
    FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` sales_detail
    INNER JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderHeader` sales_header
      ON sales_detail.SalesOrderID = sales_header.SalesOrderID
    GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM OrderDate), TerritoryID
  ),
  ranking_order_quantity AS(
    SELECT
      yr, TerritoryID, order_cnt,
      DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY yr ORDER BY order_cnt DESC) rk
    FROM territory_vs_order_count
  )
SELECT * FROM ranking_order_quantity WHERE rk <= 3 ORDER BY yr DESC;
```

**📊 Actual Output:**
![Query 3 Output](Images/Query_3_Output.png)

**💡 Observations:**

Territory 4 is the strongest region every year from 2011 to 2014, growing from 3,238 orders to 11,632 orders - almost 4 times bigger.

Territory 6 and Territory 1 are always second and third. This pattern is consistent, showing these three regions are the most important and stable for the business.

---

### Query 4: Seasonal Discount Efficiency

*Question: Calc Total Discount Cost belongs to Seasonal Discount for each SubCategory.*

> _Calculating the total cost of seasonal discounts per subcategory lets the finance team evaluate whether the promotions are worth the margin loss - and which categories are eating the most discount budget._

```sql
WITH
  combined_sales_info AS(
    SELECT
      detail.ProductID, product.ProductSubcategoryID, subcate.Name subcate_name,
      header.OrderDate order_date, detail.OrderQty order_qnt, detail.UnitPrice unit_price,
      detail.SpecialOfferID, offer.DiscountPct discount_pct, offer.Type discount_type
    FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` detail
    INNER JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderHeader` header ON detail.SalesOrderID = header.SalesOrderID
    INNER JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.SpecialOffer` offer ON detail.SpecialOfferID = offer.SpecialOfferID
    INNER JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` product ON detail.ProductID = product.ProductID
    INNER JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` subcate ON CAST(product.ProductSubcategoryID AS INT64) = subcate.ProductSubcategoryID
  ),
  calculated_discount_cost AS(
    SELECT
      EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) year, subcate_name,
      (discount_pct * unit_price * order_qnt) discount_cost
    FROM combined_sales_info WHERE discount_type = 'Seasonal Discount'
  )
SELECT year, subcate_name, SUM(discount_cost) total_cost
FROM calculated_discount_cost GROUP BY year, subcate_name ORDER BY year;
```

**📊 Actual Output:**
![Query 4 Output](Images/Query_4_Output.png)

**💡 Observations:**

Helmets is the only product getting discounts. The discount cost doubled from $828 in 2012 to $1,606 in 2013.

The store should check if these discounts are actually bringing more sales and profit, or if they're just cutting into margins without enough benefit.

---

### Query 5: Cohort Retention Rate

*Question: Retention rate of Customer in 2014 with status of Successfully Shipped (Cohort Analysis).*

> _Cohort retention shows exactly when customers stop coming back after their first purchase - giving the CRM team a window to step in with re-engagement campaigns before churn becomes permanent._

```sql
WITH successful_order AS (
    SELECT  
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM ModifiedDate) order_month, CustomerID customer_id
    FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderHeader` 
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ModifiedDate) = 2014 AND Status = 5 ORDER BY customer_id, order_month
),
rank_time_order AS (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_month) order_time
    FROM successful_order
),
first_order AS (
    SELECT order_month AS month_join, customer_id
    FROM rank_time_order WHERE order_time = 1
),
find_month_diff AS (
    SELECT distinct order_month, month_join, a.customer_id, (order_month - month_join) month_diff_num
    FROM successful_order a INNER JOIN first_order b ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id
    ORDER BY month_join, order_month
)
SELECT month_join, CONCAT('M-',month_diff_num) month_diff, COUNT(customer_id) customer_count
FROM find_month_diff GROUP BY month_join, CONCAT('M-',month_diff_num) ORDER BY month_join, month_diff;
```

**📊 Actual Output:**
![Query 5 Output](Images/Query_5_Output.png)

**💡 Observations:**

Most customers only buy once. In the first month, 2,076 people bought, but by the next month only 78 came back - a huge drop.

But at month 3, more customers come back to buy again (around 250). This might be a seasonal pattern, so the store should send emails or offers to bring customers back at that time.

---

### Query 6: Stock Trend MoM

*Question: Trend of Stock level & MoM diff % by all product in 2011. If %gr rate is null then 0. Round to 1 decimal.*

> _Month-over-month stock changes reveal whether inventory is building up or running low for each product - helping the warehouse team avoid both overstock and stockout situations._

```sql
WITH
  stock_info_2011 AS (
    SELECT 
      EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.ModifiedDate) yr, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.ModifiedDate) mth,
      StockedQty, o.ProductID, p.Name product_name
    FROM `adventureworks2019.Production.WorkOrder` o
    INNER JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` p ON o.ProductID = p.ProductID
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.ModifiedDate) = 2011  
  ),
  sum_stock_qty AS(
    SELECT product_name, mth, yr, SUM(StockedQty) stock_qty
    FROM stock_info_2011 GROUP BY product_name, mth, yr
  )
SELECT
  a.product_name, a.mth, a.yr, a.stock_qty, b.stock_qty AS stock_prv,
  IFNULL(ROUND((a.stock_qty / b.stock_qty - 1) *100.0,1), 0) diff
FROM sum_stock_qty a
LEFT JOIN sum_stock_qty b ON a.product_name = b.product_name AND a.mth = b.mth + 1 
ORDER BY a.stock_qty DESC;
```

**📊 Actual Output:**
![Query 6 Output](Images/Query_06_Output.png)

**💡 Observations:**

In July 2011, some mountain frames suddenly got much more stock - like HL Mountain Frame Silver jumped from 5 to 59 units. This looks like a reaction to running out, not planned ordering.

The store should use better demand forecasting so they stock products before they run out, instead of scrambling to restock later.

---

### Query 7: Stock-to-Sales Ratio

*Question: Calc Ratio of Stock / Sales in 2011 by product name, by month. Order results by month desc, ratio desc. Round Ratio to 1 decimal.*

> _A high stock-to-sales ratio means the company is holding more inventory than it's selling - tying up cash. This query flags which products need faster turnover or reduced production._

```sql
WITH 
  sales_2011 AS(
    SELECT 
      EXTRACT (MONTH FROM OrderDate) mth, EXTRACT (year FROM OrderDate) yr,
      detail.ProductID, p.Name, SUM(OrderQty) sales
    FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` detail
    INNER JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderHeader` header ON detail.SalesOrderID = header.SalesOrderID
    INNER JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` p ON detail.ProductID = p.ProductID
    WHERE EXTRACT (year FROM OrderDate) = 2011 GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4
  ),
  stock_2011 AS (
    SELECT 
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.ModifiedDate) mth, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.ModifiedDate) yr,
      o.ProductID, p.Name product_name, SUM(StockedQty) stock
    FROM `adventureworks2019.Production.WorkOrder` o
    INNER JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` p ON o.ProductID = p.ProductID
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.ModifiedDate) = 2011 GROUP BY 1,2,3,4)
SELECT
  sa.mth, sa.yr, sa.ProductId, sa.Name, sales, stock, ROUND((stock/sales), 1) ratio
FROM sales_2011 sa
LEFT JOIN stock_2011 st ON sa.mth = st.mth AND sa.productID = st.productID
ORDER BY 1 DESC, 7 DESC;
```

**📊 Actual Output:**
![Query 7 Output](Images/Query_7_Output.png)

**💡 Observations:**

In December 2011, some products have way too much stock. HL Mountain Frame Black has 27 units in stock but only sold 1 - that's 27 times more stock than needed.

This shows the store ordered too much of these frames. They should reduce orders for these products and focus on items that sell faster.

---

### Query 8: Pending Orders Breakdown

*Question: No of order and value at Pending status in 2014.*

> _Pending purchase orders represent committed but undelivered spend - tracking their total value helps the procurement team manage cash flow and follow up with suppliers before delays impact production._

```sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM header.ModifiedDate) yr, Status,
  COUNT(DISTINCT header.PurchaseOrderID) order_cnt,
  SUM(TotalDue) value
FROM `adventureworks2019.Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail` detail 
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader` header
  ON detail.PurchaseOrderID = header.PurchaseOrderID
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM header.ModifiedDate) = 2014 AND Status = 1
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

**📊 Actual Output:**
![Query 8 Output](Images/Query_8_Output.png)

**💡 Observations:**

In 2014, there are 224 orders waiting to be delivered worth about $9.27M. This is a lot of money sitting in pending orders.

The store should check with suppliers to make sure these orders arrive on time, so production and sales don't get delayed.

---

## 🎯 Key Findings

**Revenue Concentration:** Road Bikes dominates sales ($2.1M in March 2014), but only 3 product categories (Road, Mountain, Touring Bikes) generate ~80% of revenue. **Action:** Diversify product portfolio to reduce dependency.

**Fast-Growing Segments:** Mountain Frames (+510%), Socks (+421%), and Road Frames (+389%) show explosive growth. **Action:** Increase production capacity and marketing budget immediately.

**Territorial Dominance:** Territory 4 is 4x stronger than others (3,238→11,632 orders, 2011-2014). **Action:** Investigate success factors and replicate in underperforming territories.

**Discount Inefficiency:** Only Helmets receive seasonal discounts ($828→$1,606), but profitability impact unclear. **Action:** Conduct ROI analysis before expanding discount programs.

**Customer Retention Crisis:** 96% of 2014 customers never returned (2,076→78 by month 2). Seasonal uptick at month 3 suggests opportunity. **Action:** Launch re-engagement campaigns timed to seasonal patterns.

**Poor Inventory Planning:** Stock surges (HL Mountain Frame: 5→59 units) indicate reactive restocking, not demand forecasting. **Action:** Implement predictive ordering system to avoid stock-outs.

**Excess Stock Levels:** Stock-to-sales ratio >20x for slow-moving frames (27 units in stock, 1 sold). **Action:** Free up $M+ in working capital by reducing overstock.

**Supply Chain Risk:** $9.27M in 224 pending purchase orders (2014) pose production delay risks. **Action:** Establish supplier SLA monitoring to prevent pipeline breaks.
